# El Xtanco · immersive 3D

Open `/admira-xp/?autostart=xtanco&visual=better` or choose **Avanzado (▤) → Better · 16 bits**. The same selector is available inside the views: **Good · 8 bits**, **Better · 16 bits**, **Best · 32 bits**, **Matrix · Avenida Admira**. The homepage's **Try the twin** uses Better; `visual=life` remains an alias. Escape / **Volver al gemelo** returns to Good and its operational tools without starting another game.

This is a stylized, procedural representation of the running layout, not a scan or a claim of photorealism. Customers are the existing game actors, not newly inferred camera detections. Camera-owned exterior traffic is not replaced with synthetic pedestrians.

## Ownership

- `life-snapshot.mjs` reads `__xtancoVisualState()`: layout, actors, palette, movement and existing counters. Stable actor identities, explicit palette conversion, no writes to simulation.
- `life-scene.mjs` builds beveled furniture, textured surfaces, articulated characters and three lighting moods. It owns geometry/materials/textures, not a clock or network. Positions interpolate over 100 ms visually; source positions remain intact.
- `life-renderer.mjs` owns the local Three.js renderer, orthographic camera, pointer/pinch/keyboard camera actions and selection. Render is driven by the UI. Scene disposal releases GPU resources.
- `life-ui.mjs` opens an isolated native modal, reads state at 10 Hz and renders while visible. It dynamically loads Three.js only on launch. It closes if the current game state can no longer be represented. `__xtancoReleaseInputs()` releases held gameplay keys when entering the modal.

The public tiers are **Good = classic**, **Better = stylized 3D**, **Best = live 3D with Blender furniture and detailed human assets**. Best always mounts the live renderer; `inventory=1` is no longer required. People, transforms and inventory changes come from the same snapshot. No concept photograph or flat person sprite replaces the room. If a human asset fails to load, its existing stylized model stays visible and the status labels it provisional. `xtanco-visual-tiers.mjs` owns routing and the versioned preference `xtanco_visual_tier_v2`; the old wireframe/hybrid preference is not migrated. `__xtancoPremiumView` remains a compatibility façade with no composition, keeping original operation callbacks intact. Legacy `data-xtanco-visual` stays `good` so camera traffic cannot acquire the old wireframe style; the public tier uses `data-xtanco-tier`.

The permanent Expert menu, CLI and control panels remain available around every tier. All immersive digital screens sample one shared canvas via the existing `__xtoreWindowPlayer.draw()` source. No extra video, stream, iframe or simulation is created by this view. Audio, measurement and operational interactions remain owned by the original game. Best's asset pipeline and pending real-world references are described in [best-production.md](./best-production.md).

## Controls

**Comparar con Good** uses a mapped orthographic camera aligned to the classic projection. This is a presentation comparison: model silhouettes and operational controls can still differ. **Explorar 3D** uses an independent camera: drag to orbit the cutaway, Shift+drag / right-drag to pan, wheel or pinch to zoom. Select objects or people to inspect existing labels. Escape returns to Good. Day / sunset / night changes presentation lighting only, never physical lights or the game clock.

`/modo best` opens the live 3D view. **Vista general**, **Detalle** and the zoom buttons control its camera; click a person or object to see its label. Escape returns to Good. The loading status reports detailed human assets still loading or using a provisional model. A renderer error remains explicit and offers the shared Good/Better controls. A successful local result includes `ok:true`, `preview:true` and `availability:"preview"`; it confirms a rendered frame of the 3D scene, not implementation of all 30 operational areas. The `preview` value is retained for compatibility while those capabilities are developed. `/modo` is not an MCP tool. The [functional catalog](../../mcp/funcionalidades.json) retains stable IDs and pending Best capabilities.

## Shared visitor appearances

Matrix, Better and Best use the same [24 fictional profiles](../assets/people/matrix-v2/README.md). `visitor-profiles.mjs` keeps one appearance per live customer or passer-by across snapshot adapters and visual-tier switches. New visitors prefer the least-used compatible profile; existing source demographics, palettes and counters remain untouched. A larger compatible crowd may repeat profiles. Staff and special actors are excluded. Matrix uses transparent photo atlases, Better builds procedural variants, and Best adapts the existing four rigged body bases with private materials, hair, accessories and body scales. The detailed 3D variants share appearance cues, not identical photographic faces.

## Checks

`node --test admira-xp/scripts/life-*.test.mjs homepage-twin-cta.test.mjs`

Browser QA: direct entry, furniture selection, camera presets, lighting, portrait layout, close/reopen and failure fallback. Check the preserved premium/controller/operations suite before publishing. WebGL is required; if it cannot start, the modal offers retry or return to the existing game.


## Matrix · Avenida Admira

Open `/admira-xp/?play=xtanco&visual=matrix`, choose **04.- Matrix** in Advanced/Expert or enter `/modo matrix` (also `matrix`). `quality=matrix` is accepted as a URL alias; explicit `visual` takes precedence, then `quality`, then the saved preference. Matrix presents Avenida Admira as a layered 2.5D composition with a fixed camera, editable furniture and live cutout visitors. The clean room is the only backdrop; independently rendered pieces follow the shared layout, so removed furniture cannot remain baked into the background. The 43 inventory models have transparent Blender renders in four orientations; calibrated photographic cutouts preserve the original appearance where applicable. `/inventario` lists the stable model numbers. `/inventario añadir 1`, `/inventario eliminar mostrador` and `/inventario deshacer` update the same inventory used in Good/Better/Best. Adding creates or restores one unit; removing retires all units of the named model. `/mudanza` hides the contents while preserving the current layout, and a second invocation restores them. Inventory edits keep Matrix selected.

`matrix-preview-ui.mjs` owns its background, furniture and person-layer lifecycle independently of `best-preview-ui.mjs`. Readiness waits for the background and furniture assets; failures are reported. People consume the current furniture footprints, and individual furniture pieces and visitors share depth ordering. The shared router cancels pending views, rejects stale readiness events and preserves the selected preference on pagehide. Matrix is a fixed-camera 2.5D presentation, with no orbital camera or claim of full 3D operational feature parity. See [the inventory CLI guide](../../inventario/CLI.md).
